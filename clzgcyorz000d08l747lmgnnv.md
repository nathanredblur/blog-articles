Who am I?

Hi, I'm Jonathan Rico, a dynamic front-end developer with a keen eye for user-centric design. With a solid foundation in frameworks like React, Redux, and Next.js, I bring over a decade of hands-on experience in the evolving landscape of web development.

I've actively contributed to large-scale projects, leveraging a data-driven approach and collaborating with UX designers to architect optimal front-end solutions. Mentoring new developers is not just a task, it's a passion that fuels my commitment to continuous learning.

Let's innovate together!
